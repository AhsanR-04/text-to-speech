## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Issues (High Priority) - ~3 hours
Focus on immediate fixes that address security, performance, and user experience issues:

1. **Task 1**: Fix memory leaks (30 min)
2. **Task 2**: Improve error handling (1 hour)
3. **Task 3**: Input validation and sanitization (45 min)
4. **Task 4**: Implement debouncing (1 hour)

**Impact**: Fixes critical bugs, improves performance, enhances security

### Phase 2: Architecture Improvements (Medium Priority) - ~10-13 hours
Refactor for better maintainability and user experience:

5. **Task 5**: Modular architecture (3-4 hours)
6. **Task 6**: Error recovery mechanisms (2-3 hours)
7. **Task 7**: State management (2.5-3 hours)
8. **Task 8**: Accessibility improvements (2-3 hours)

**Impact**: Better code organization, enhanced accessibility, improved error handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Low Priority) - ~14-19 hours
Add modern development practices and advanced features:

9. **Task 9**: Convert to TypeScript (4-5 hours)
10. **Task 10**: Build process and optimization (3-4 hours)
11. **Task 11**: Progressive Web App features (4-6 hours)
12. **Task 12**: Comprehensive documentation (3-4 hours)

**Impact**: Type safety, modern tooling, PWA capabilities, better documentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Review the [CODE_REVIEW.md](../CODE_REVIEW.md) document first
- Ensure you have the current application running
- Set up development environment with proper tools

### Recommended Approach

1. **Start with High Priority tasks** - These address immediate issues
2. **Complete tasks within each priority level** before moving to the next
3. **Test thoroughly after each task** to ensure no regressions
4. **Update documentation** as you implement changes

### Task Dependencies

Some tasks have dependencies on others:

- **Task 5** (Modular Architecture) should be completed before Task 9 (TypeScript)
- **Task 7** (State Management) works well with Task 5 (Modular Architecture)
- **Task 10** (Build Process) should come before Task 11 (PWA Features)
- **Task 12** (Documentation) should be done after major architectural changes

### Testing Strategy

Each task includes acceptance criteria and testing guidelines. Make sure to:

- Run existing functionality tests after each task
- Add new tests for new functionality
- Test across different browsers and devices
- Validate performance improvements with browser dev tools

## Quality Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Bundle size: < 500KB gzipped
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Memory usage: Stable during long sessions
- DOM update frequency: Reduced by 70-80%

### Code Quality Targets
- TypeScript coverage: 100% (after Task 9)
- ESLint errors: 0
- Test coverage: > 80%
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### User Experience Targets
- Error recovery rate: > 90%
- Speech recognition accuracy: Based on browser capabilities
- Offline functionality: View and edit saved transcripts
- Cross-browser compatibility: Chrome, Edge, Safari

## Notes

- Each task is designed to be completed independently when possible
- Estimated times are for experienced developers
- Some tasks may uncover additional issues that need addressing
- Regular testing and validation is crucial throughout the process
- Consider the long-term maintenance implications of architectural decisions

## Support

For questions or clarification on any task:
1. Review the detailed task documentation
2. Refer to the original code review findings
3. Check browser compatibility requirements
4. Test implementations thoroughly
